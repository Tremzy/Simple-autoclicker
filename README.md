# Simple-autoclicker
A very simple autoclicker with modifiable click speed, and toggle key.
- You can hide the window with INSERT on your keyboard.
- You can close the autoclicker with END on your keyboard.
- You can save the config for later use (automatic load on startup)

The "Self destruct" button doesnt work currently.
